instack-undercloud virt setup
=============================

You should select a host machine with at least 12G of memory and 200G disk space. The virt setup creates 5 virtual
machines consisting of 2G of memory and 30G of disk space each.  If you do not plan to deploy Block Storage or Swift
Storage nodes, you can delete those virtual machines and require less space accordingly.  Most of the virtual machine
disk files are thinly provisioned and won't take up the full 30G.  The undercloud is not thinly provisioned and will is
completely pre-allocated.

If you're connecting to the virt host remotely from ssh, you will need to use the -t flag to force pseudo-tty
allocation or enable notty via a $USER.notty file.

Some recommended default environment variables before starting:

        # disk size in GB to set for each virtual machine created
        NODE_DISK=30

        # memory in MB allocated for each virtual machine created
        NODE_MEM=2048

        # Operating system distribution to set for each virtual machine created
        NODE_DIST=fedora

        # CPU count assigned to each virtual machine created
        NODE_CPU=1

        # 64 bit architecture
        NODE_ARCH=amd64

1. Add export of LIVBIRT_DEFAULT_URI to your bashrc file.

        echo 'export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI="qemu:///system"' >> ~/.bashrc

1. Install the openstack-m repository

        sudo yum -y install http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack-m/openstack-m/openstack-m-release-icehouse-2.noarch.rpm

1. Enable the fedora-openstack-m-testing yum repository.

        sudo yum -y install yum-utils
        sudo yum-config-manager --enable fedora-openstack-m-testing

1. Install instack-undercloud

        sudo yum -y install instack-undercloud

1. Run script to install required dependencies

        sudo yum install -y libguestfs-tools
        source /usr/libexec/openstack-tripleo/devtest_variables.sh
        tripleo install-dependencies

   After running this command, you will need to log out and log back in for the changes to be applied.  If you plan to
   use virt-manager or boxes to visually manage the virtual machines created in the next step, this would be a good time
   to install those tools now.

1. Run script to setup your virtual environment.

        export NODE_DISK=30
        instack-virt-setup

   You should now have a vm called instack that you can use for the instack-undercloud installation that contains a minimal
   install of Fedora 20 x86_64. The instack vm contains a user "stack" that uses the password "stack" and is granted
   password-less sudo privileges.  The root password is "redhat".

1. Get MAC addresses

   When setting up the undercloud on the instack virtual machine, you will need the MAC addresses of the baremetal node
   virtual machines.  Use the following command to obtain the list of addresses you can add to your deploy-overcloudrc
   file later.

         for i in $(seq 0 3); do echo -n $(tripleo get-vm-mac baremetal_$i) " "; done; echo

Note that you don't have to use the pre-created instack vm and could instead create a new one via some other method
(virt-install, virt-clone, etc). If you do so however make sure all the NIC interfaces are set to use virtio, and also
manually add an additional interface to the vm by adding the following the libvirt xml for the domain (you may need to
adjust slot as needed):

        <interface type='network'>
          <source network='brbm'/>
          <model type='virtio'/>
          <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x09' function='0x0'/>
        </interface>

Once the vm is installed, start and logon to the vm, obtain the IP address and then return to the
[README-packages](README-packages.md).
